# AWS Cost Optimization Power

AWS cost optimization tools for business teams and developers. Analyze spending, get optimization recommendations, and build cost-aware applications with AWS Well-Architected best practices.

## Introduction

Kiro Powers extend your AI development environment with specialized capabilities for specific domains and workflows. This AWS Cost Optimization Power brings together multiple AWS cost management services into a unified, intelligent interface that helps you understand, optimize, and control your cloud spending.

Whether you're a FinOps professional managing organizational budgets, a developer building cost-aware applications, or an architect designing efficient infrastructure, this power provides the tools and guidance you need. Instead of switching between multiple AWS consoles and learning different APIs, you can use natural language to query costs, analyze spending patterns, get optimization recommendations, and model infrastructure costs - all within your development workflow.

The power integrates three AWS Labs MCP servers to provide:
- **Real-time cost analysis** from AWS Cost Explorer and Billing APIs
- **Pricing intelligence** for architecture decisions and cost modeling  
- **Operational insights** from CloudWatch for performance-cost correlation

Built around the AWS Well-Architected Cost Optimization Pillar's five design principles, this power helps you implement cloud financial management, adopt consumption models, measure efficiency, leverage managed services, and analyze expenditure attribution - turning cost optimization from a reactive process into a proactive development practice.

---

## Onboarding

### Prerequisites

Before using the AWS Cost Optimizer Power, ensure you have:

1. **AWS CLI** (version 2.32.0 or later recommended)
   - Check: `aws --version`
   - Install: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

2. **UV** (Python package manager)
   - Check: `uv --version`
   - Install: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

### Step 1: Configure AWS Credentials

You must ensure that there are valid AWS credentials. This is required for all cost management tools to function properly.

**Configure credentials using one of these methods:**

#### Option A: AWS CLI Configure
```bash
aws configure
```
Enter your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format.

#### Option B: Environment Variables
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

#### Option C: AWS SSO
```bash
aws configure sso
```

**Verify credentials:**
```bash
AWS_PAGER="" aws sts get-caller-identity
```

**Important for MCP Servers**: The MCP servers in this power use AWS credential files (`~/.aws/credentials`) rather than environment variables. If you're using temporary credentials (like AWS SSO or session tokens), ensure they are saved to the credential file, not just set as environment variables.

### Step 2: Enable Cost Explorer (if not already enabled)

Cost Explorer is enabled by default for most AWS accounts, but verify:
1. Go to AWS Billing Console → Cost Explorer
2. If prompted, click "Enable Cost Explorer"
3. Wait 24 hours for initial data population

### Step 3: Configure Billing and Monitoring Permissions

Ensure your AWS user/role has the required permissions:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ce:*",
                "budgets:*",
                "pricing:*",
                "organizations:ListAccounts",
                "organizations:DescribeOrganization",
                "support:*",
                "cur:*",
                "cloudwatch:*",
                "logs:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 4: Start Using the Power

Once credentials are configured, you can immediately start using the power:
- "Show me my monthly AWS costs"
- "Find my most expensive services"
- "Monitor my existing budgets"

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:

- **Start with high-level analysis** (service-level costs) before drilling down to resources
- **Use appropriate time ranges** - daily for recent analysis, monthly for trends
- **Leverage auto-approval patterns** - most read operations are automatically approved
- **Combine multiple tools** for thorough analysis (cost + optimization + pricing)
- **Set up budget monitoring** with multiple alert thresholds (50%, 80%, 100%)
- **Monitor anomalies regularly** - set up automated anomaly detection
- **Use tags consistently** for accurate cost allocation and chargeback
- **Analyze Reserved Instance utilization** monthly to optimize commitments
- **Compare costs month-over-month** to identify trends and drivers
- **Use SQL analytics** for complex custom analysis and reporting

### ❌ Don't:

- **Query very long time ranges** without reason (expensive and slow)
- **Ignore cost forecasts** - use them for budget planning and capacity decisions
- **Skip dimension exploration** - use get_dimension_values to understand your data
- **Forget regional differences** - pricing varies significantly by region
- **Overlook Free Tier usage** - monitor to avoid unexpected charges
- **Ignore budget performance** - regularly check budget status and utilization
- **Ignore optimization recommendations** - they represent real savings opportunities
- **Use only On-Demand pricing** - consider Reserved Instances and Savings Plans
- **Assume you can create/modify budgets** - this power provides read-only budget monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Errors
- Verify credentials are valid: `AWS_PAGER="" aws sts get-caller-identity`
- Check IAM permissions for Cost Explorer, Budgets, and Pricing APIs
- Ensure Cost Explorer is enabled in your AWS account
- For Organizations: verify access to consolidated billing data

### "No Data Available" Errors
- AWS cost data has 24-48 hour delay - check date ranges
- Verify date ranges are within available data periods (last 13 months)
- For new accounts: wait 24 hours after first resource usage

### MCP Server Connection Issues
- Verify UV is installed: `uv --version`
- Check AWS credentials configuration
- Restart Kiro to reconnect MCP servers
- Review MCP server logs for specific errors

### CloudWatch Access Issues
**Problem**: CloudWatch metrics or logs not accessible
**Symptoms**:
- "Access Denied" errors when querying metrics
- Empty results from metric queries
- Log group access failures

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify CloudWatch permissions**:
   ```bash
   aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace AWS/EC2 --max-records 1
   ```
2. **Check log group permissions**:
   ```bash
   aws logs describe-log-groups --max-items 1
   ```
3. **Ensure proper IAM policies** include CloudWatch and Logs permissions
4. **Verify region consistency** between queries and resources

### "ExpiredTokenException" or MCP Credential Issues
**Problem**: MCP servers show expired token errors even when AWS CLI works fine.

**Root Cause**: MCP servers use AWS credential files (`~/.aws/credentials`) rather than environment variables, and may cache old credentials even after restart.

**Solution**:
1. **Update AWS credential file** with fresh credentials:
   ```bash
   # Edit ~/.aws/credentials file directly
   [default]
   aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
   aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
   aws_session_token = YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN  # If using temporary credentials
   ```

2. **Restart MCP servers** in Kiro to pick up new credentials

3. **Verify credentials work**:
   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```

**Note**: Environment variables (`export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...`) alone are not sufficient for MCP servers. The credential file must be updated for MCP servers to authenticate properly.
