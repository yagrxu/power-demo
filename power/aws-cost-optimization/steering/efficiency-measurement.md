## Workflow 1: Business Value Cost Correlation

**Goal**: Establish correlation between cloud costs and business value metrics

### Steps:

1. **Define Business Value Metrics**
   ```
   Identify key business metrics such as:
   - Revenue per customer
   - Transactions processed
   - Active users
   - Business outcomes delivered
   ```

2. **Correlate Costs with Business Metrics**
   ```
   Use session_sql to create correlations:
   - Cost per customer acquisition
   - Cost per transaction
   - Cost per active user
   - Cost per business outcome
   ```

      FROM cost_data 
      WHERE date >= '2024-06-01'
      GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', date)
    ),
    business_metrics AS (
      SELECT
