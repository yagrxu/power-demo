## Overview

The AWS Cost Optimization Power transforms how teams manage cloud spending by bringing intelligent cost analysis, real-time pricing insights, and automated recommendations directly into your development environment. Whether you're a FinOps professional managing budgets, a developer building cost-aware applications, or an architect designing efficient infrastructure, this power provides the tools and guidance you need—all through natural language.

## Why This Power?

**Stop context switching.** Instead of juggling multiple AWS consoles and learning different APIs, query costs, analyze spending patterns, get optimization recommendations, and model infrastructure costs—all within Kiro.

**Built on AWS best practices.** Implements the AWS Well-Architected Cost Optimization Pillar's five design principles, helping you turn cost optimization from a reactive process into a proactive development practice.

**Three powerful integrations.** Combines AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Pricing API, and CloudWatch into a unified, intelligent interface.

## Key Capabilities

### For Business & FinOps Teams

- **Cloud Financial Management** - Implement cost governance, monitor budgets, and establish accountability frameworks
- **Cost Analysis & Forecasting** - Historical analysis, multi-dimensional breakdowns, and trend identification
- **Optimization & Governance** - Automated rightsizing, RI/SP analysis, and anomaly detection

### For Developers & Engineering Teams

- **Pre-Deployment Cost Analysis** - Model CDK and Terraform projects before deployment
- **Development Environment Optimization** - Analyze dev/test costs and monitor Free Tier usage
- **Cost-Aware Development** - Real-time pricing intelligence for architecture decisions

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI** (v2.32.0+) - [Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
2. **UV** (Python package manager) - [Installation Guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
3. **AWS Credentials** - Configured via `aws configure` or environment variables

### Installation

1. Install the power in Kiro
2. Ensure AWS credentials are configured
3. Start using natural language commands

### Try These Commands

**For FinOps Teams:**
```
"Show me our AWS costs for the last 3 months by business unit"
"Find cost optimization opportunities across our organization"
"Compare our costs between last quarter and this quarter"
```

**For Developers:**
```
"Provide cost estimates for this CDK stack before deployment"
"Compare Lambda vs ECS costs for my microservice"
"Show me pricing differences between us-east-1 and eu-west-1"
```
